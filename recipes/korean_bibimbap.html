    <p>
        Bibimbap is a large bowl of rice topped with an array of individually 
        prepared vegetables and meat and served with a gochujang sauce. Bibim 
        means mixing, and bap means rice. The mixing usually happens at the table by 
        the diner.

        In Korea, there are many different types of bibimbap depending on toppings, 
        regions, sauces, etc. Sannamul (wild vegetables) bibimbap, jeyuk (spicy pork) 
        bibimbap, haemul (seafood) bibimbap, and yeolmu (young radish greens) bibimbap 
        are a few examples.

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook the rice, without soaking and using a little less water 
            than the amount you normally use. The rice for bibimbap should 
            be a little drier than usual for best results.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Meat</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut beef into thin 2-inch long strips. Mix in 1.5 tablespoons of 
            soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of sesame oil, 2 teaspoons 
            of rice wine, 1 tablespoon of chopped scallion, 1 teaspoon minced 
            garlic, 1/2 sesame seeds and a pinch of pepper. Marinate for 20 minutes. 
            Sauté in a skillet for 2-3 minutes over high heat.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Vgetables</h3>

        <li>
            Bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the bean sprouts and briefly blanch, 
            about 1 minute, flipping over once. Drain quickly and shock in cold water 
            to stop cooking. Drain again. Toss with 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon 
            of sesame oil, 1/2 teaspoon of sesame seeds, and salt (about 1/2 teaspoon).
        </li>
        <li>
            Blanch the spinach in salted boiling water only until wilted, about 40 seconds. 
            Drain quickly and shock in cold water. Squeeze out water. Cut into 3-inch lengths. 
            Toss with 1 tablespoon of chopped scallion, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 teaspoon 
            of sesame oil, 1/2 teaspoon of sesame seeds and salt (about 1/2 teaspoon).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and then thinly slice crosswise. Generously sprinkle 
            salt (about 1/2 teaspoon) over sliced cucumbers and set aside for 10 - 15 minutes. 
            Squeeze out excess liquid. Toss with 1 tablespoon of chopped scallion, 1/2 teaspoon minced
